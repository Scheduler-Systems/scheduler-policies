WHAT IS PERSONAL DATA?

Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute Personal Data.

WHAT ARE THE LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING YOUR DATA?

The following informs you about the legal basis of us processing your data and unless the legal basis is not specifically mentioned, the following applies: 

Consent: This is where we have asked you to provide explicit permission to process your data for a particular purpose. 

Contract: This is where we process your information to fulfill a contractual arrangement we have made with you. 

Legitimate Interests: This is where we rely on our interests as a reason for processing; generally, this is to provide you with the best services in the most secure and appropriate way. Of course, before relying on any of those legitimate interests, we balance them against your interests and make sure they are compelling enough and will not cause any unwarranted harm.

Legal Obligation: This is where we have a statutory or other legal obligation to process the information, such as for the investigation of crime. 

WHAT PERSONAL DATA DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU?

We may collect and process the following Personal Data about you:

a) Personal Data that you give us:
This is information about you that you give to us. It may include, for example, your name, email address, and phone number when you contact us. The legal basis is the initiation of a contract with you and your consent. 

We also process the Personal Data when you create an account in order to be able to provide you access to our Services. The Data you submit typically includes your name, email address, phone number, password and your job category. The legal basis is the initiation of a contract with you and your consent. 

We may collect and process information about your location (coarse location) and the time the location information is recorded to provide the services with location-based information and features. Some of these services require your Personal Data for the feature to work and we may associate location data with your device ID and other information we hold about you. 

Alternatively, you are able to sign up using the convenience login and sign up from Google/Apple. For convenience login and sign up, you will be asked to provide your basic information (i.e., name, email address, and display picture) linked to your account. When registering via convenience functions, you agree to the relevant terms and conditions and consent to certain data from your Google/Apple profile being transferred to us.

As a registered user, you have the opportunity to create a user profile (Employee/Manager or Employee) with just a few clicks and details, and the relevant profile data you provide will be posted on your profile. Of course, you can change or remove the information or delete your profile at any time via the settings in your profile. The legal basis for the processing of your Personal Data is the establishment and implementation of the user contract for the use of our Services.

If you wish to use our App and its features, we process the Personal Data and Content you voluntarily provide for the purpose of providing your App. Depending on how you use our App, you may provide Content, Personal Data and Chat with other users. 

While we need certain Personal Data to allow you to participate on our App your Personal Data is never shared without a lawful reason. However, Content uploaded by will be made available and may be viewed and otherwise accessed by other users connected to your account. In turn, we may process:

Content Data includes photos, text messages, or other digital content you create, broadcast, perform, or upload on our App and information about the content you create, broadcast, perform, or upload, including metadata that is provided with that content. Please remember that Content Data that you transmit may reveal personal data about yourself as well, including identifying information about yourself depicted in any photos or videos.

Data you provide may be considered “sensitive”. This includes data that could cause harm to an individual or company if released. By choosing to provide this data, you consent to our processing of that data. You have choices about the data you provide and how you share it. Please do not share information that you would not want to be available. The legal basis for the processing of your Data is the establishment and implementation of the user contract for the use of the service as well as your consent. 

Of course, we also process your chats and communications with other users as well as the content you may provide to others through our App as you interact with them. 

We process both Personal Data and Non-Personal Data involved in your use of our App, such as the data you provide (“Service Data"), in order to be able to provide you access to and use of our App. For this purpose, all Service Data processed by us will be processed on your behalf, and we become your Data Processor. Doing so we provide you complete control of your Service Data by providing you the ability to (i) access your Service Data, (ii) share your Service Data through supported third-party integrations, and (iii) request export or deletion of your Service Data and take appropriate legal precautions and corresponding technical and organizational measures to ensure the protection of your Service Data. 

Some jurisdictions may require you to disclose your use of our services as your processor in your privacy policy and/or data processing agreement as applicable. For this purpose, all Personal Data processed by us will be stored locally on the users device and in part on our Google Firebase server. We take appropriate legal precautions and corresponding technical and organisational measures to ensure the protection of service data and Personal Data in accordance with the PPL and GDPR.

The legal basis for providing the above is the fulfilment of the user contract for the use of the App as well as your consent. 

We process data in the context of administrative tasks as well as organisation of our business, and compliance with legal obligations, such as archiving. In this regard, we process the same data that we process in the course of providing our contractual services. The processing bases are our legal obligations and our legitimate interest. 

If you create a support ticket, we will request Personal Data and, where applicable, non-Personal Data in accordance with your request; this may include your name, email address and other order related data you voluntarily provide. The data provided is not shared with third parties and cannot read your data when it is entered. If you submit a support ticket, we process the data for the purpose of processing and handling your ticket. Our employees will also have access to data that you knowingly share with us for technical support or to import data into our services. We communicate our privacy and security guidelines to our employees and enforce privacy safeguards strictly. The legal basis of the data processing is our obligation to fulfil the contract and/or our legitimate interest in processing your support ticket.

Finally, if you are providing us with Personal Data relating to a third party, you agree a) that you have in place all necessary appropriate consents and b) that such third party has read this Privacy Policy. You agree to indemnify us in relation to all and any liabilities, penalties, fines, awards, or costs arising from your non-compliance with these requirements.

b) Personal Data that our App automatically collects about you: 
The App can be downloaded from the “Google Playstore'' a service offered by Google, or the Apple App service “App Store” a service of Apple, to install our App. Downloading it may require prior registration with the respective App store and/or installation of the respective App store software.

As far as we are aware, Google collects and processes the following data: Licence check, network access, network connection, WLAN connections, and location information. However, it cannot be ruled out that Google also transmits the information to a server in a third country. We cannot influence which Personal Data Google processes with your registration and the provision of downloads in the respective App store and App store software. The responsible party in this respect is solely Google as the operator of the Google Play Store. 

As far as we are aware, Apple collects and processes the following data: device identifiers, IP addresses, location information, it cannot be excluded that Apple also transmits the information to a server in a third country.

To make a purchase, you may need to provide a valid payment method (e.g., credit card). Your payment information will be collected and processed by Apple Pay/ Google Pay. We do not directly collect or store credit or debit card numbers ourselves in the ordinary course of processing transactions. The legal basis for the provision of a payment system is the establishment and implementation of the contract.

We may request permission to store your App data including your Internet Connection and Network, Push Notifications, Gallery and Camera. The legal basis for data processing is our legitimate interest, the provision of contractual or pre-contractual measures and your consent. You can deny access on your device via the Settings/Notifications/ options of your device; however, this means that our App may not function as intended.

We use the Google Firebase developer App and related features and services provided by Google. By integrating Google services, Google may collect and process information (including personal data). It cannot be excluded that Google also transfers the information to a server in a third country. We cannot influence which data Google collects and processes.

STORAGE AND RETENTION

Your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for processing the data no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, the data will be deleted once these reasons no longer apply.

If we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a so-called "processing agreement".

We may also disclose information in other circumstances, such as when you agree to it or if the law, a court order, a legal obligation, or a regulatory authority asks us to.

USA SPECIFIC PROVISIONS

The following applies to users located elsewhere in the United States. While we understand and appreciate that privacy and consumer data protection laws differ as they are subject to each state's legislature and that no data protection framework similar to the GDPR exists on a federal level, we are committed to follow and apply the for your state relevant privacy rules and regulations. 

As of the day of drafting, the following states had enacted privacy and consumer data protection laws: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. Under consideration of the similarities of the above provisions, no conflict should arise pursuing a uniform approach in granting all users in the USA the same rights and privileges as set out above. However, should ambiguity occur the most stringent provision is chosen to ensure the most comprehensive approach when it comes to protecting your Personal Data.

Further, the following also apply

“Shine the Light”
“Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section 1798.83) requires us to respond to requests from California asking about the business’s practices related to disclosing Personal Data to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. You may make a request about our collection and disclosure of your Personal Data using the contact details provided.

COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
When it comes to the collection of Personal Data from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

CAN SPAM Act
The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations. To be in accordance with CAN SPAM, we agree to the following: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us, and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.

Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)
If we process your Personal Data for the purpose of sending you SMS marketing communications, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications from us by replying or texting ‘STOP’ if you receive our SMS communications. In this respect, the data processing is carried out solely on the basis of our consent in personalized direct advertising per SMS.

Controls For Do-Not-Track Features
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, our App does not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this policy.

Right to complain
Finally, and in regard to the right to complain to a supervisory authority. You have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing of Personal Data with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. Users based in the above mentioned States may lodge a complaint with the relevant district attorney or attorney general office. However, we would appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you contact any supervisory authority.

CANADA AND MEXICO SPECIFIC PROVISIONS

Both Canada and Mexico have introduced data protection laws that are similar to the GDPR, namely Federal Law for the Protection of Personal Data in the Possession of Private Parties (“LFPDPPP”) supplemented by the Rules of the Federal Law for the Protection of Personal Data in the Possession of Private Parties in Mexico and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) in Canada. Under consideration that the GDPR has played a pivotal role, no conflict should arise pursuing a uniform approach in granting all users in Mexico or Canada the same rights and privileges as set out above. However, should ambiguity occur, the most stringent provision is chosen to ensure the most comprehensive approach when it comes to protecting your personal data.

In terms of your right to complain, Canada’s national supervisory authority is the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (www.priv.gc.ca) and the National Institute of Transparency, Access to Information and Personal Data Protection (Instituto Nacional de Transparencia, Acceso a la Información y Protección de Datos Personales) (“INAI”) is the national supervisory authority in Mexico (www.ifai.org.mx).
